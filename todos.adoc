Error detected while processing WinResized Autocommands for "*":

occurs if you start search from nvim tree!
occurs also if you do <leader>ff
Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I have a VimEnter autocommand to toggle nvim tree. or not...

TODO
I want to be able to filter quickfix so that I exclude from findings everything that has "test" in the path.
(search for instance for profile in the extensions repository. you get so many results)
this is not even supported by IntelliJ
Actually, the best would be to filter by profile-cache (because this is the directory I want to search into)

how to search file in folder (other way?) -with glob ?
TODO 
open last file opened after restart neovim (primeagen plugin?)
